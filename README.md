# CiniMagic: A Movie Recommendation System

###üåê I'm thrilled to announce that the project is now live and hosted at https://movierecommendor-1.streamlit.app/. Feel free to check it out!

## Overview
CiniMagic is a movie recommendation system built with Python, pandas, and Streamlit. It uses a dataset of movie genres and ratings to learn about user behavior and recommend movies that the user might like.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the necessary Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Streamlit app with the command `streamlit run app.py`.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the 'Home' page.
2. Rate the listed movies. Rating these movies helps the system learn about your preferences.
3. Click 'Submit'. The system will then recommend 20 movies that you might enjoy.

## Dataset
The system uses a dataset from Kaggle, which can be found in kaggle[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset?rvi=1].
